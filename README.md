## üéÆ About the Game

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can be either alive or dead, evolving according to simple rules.

### Default Rules:

1. **Underpopulation**: Live cells with fewer than 2 neighbors die
2. **Survival**: Live cells with 2 or 3 neighbors survive
3. **Overpopulation**: Live cells with more than 3 neighbors die
4. **Birth**: Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors become alive

## üõ† Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies:

- **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup with modern dialog elements
- **CSS3**: Styling, flexbox layout, responsive design, and modal animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic, DOM manipulation, and user interactions
- **DaisyUI**: Modern UI components and styling framework
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design

### Minimal Dependencies:

This project uses lightweight UI frameworks to demonstrate modern web development practices while maintaining focus on core programming concepts.

## üéØ Key Programming Concepts

### 1. **Data Structures**

- **2D Arrays**: Representing the game grid and spaceship patterns
- **State Management**: Tracking current and previous game states
- **Immutable Updates**: Creating new state rather than mutating existing
- **Pattern Libraries**: Storing and managing famous Game of Life patterns

### 2. **Algorithms**

- **Cellular Automaton**: Rule-based state transitions
- **Neighbor Detection**: Finding adjacent cells with wraparound
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detecting stabilization and oscillation
- **Random Placement**: Algorithm for positioning spaceships randomly

### 3. **DOM Manipulation**

- **Element Creation**: Dynamically generating grid cells
- **Event Handling**: Click events for cell toggling and button controls
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time UI updates during simulation
- **Modal Management**: Modern dialog element manipulation

### 4. **Functional Programming**

- **Pure Functions**: Predictable functions without side effects
- **Array Methods**: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` for data transformation
- **Function Composition**: Breaking complex logic into smaller functions
- **Pattern Matching**: Using functional approaches for rule application

### 5. **Asynchronous Programming**

- **Timers**: Using `setInterval()` for animation loops
- **State Synchronization**: Managing timer lifecycle
- **Tutorial Mode**: Implementing guided user experience with delays

### 6. **User Interface Design**

- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox for adaptive design
- **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, inputs, and clickable grid
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes and status updates
- **Modern Modals**: HTML5 dialog elements with custom styling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Tutorial mode for user onboarding

### 7. **Pattern Recognition & Mathematics**

- **Spaceship Patterns**: Implementation of famous traveling patterns
- **Rule Systems**: Flexible rule engine for different cellular automaton variants
- **Emergent Behavior**: Understanding complex patterns from simple rules

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click cells to toggle alive/dead state
- **Guided Tutorial Mode**: 166-tick introduction for new users
- **Customizable Rules**: Modify survival and birth conditions
- **Spaceship Library**: Add famous traveling patterns (Glider, LWSS, MWSS, Loafer)
- **Game Controls**: Start, stop, and reset functionality
- **Real-time Statistics**: Tick counter and pattern status
- **Rule Visualization**: Dynamic display of current rules
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful modal dialogs and responsive design
- **Pattern Detection**: Automatic detection of stabilized/oscillating patterns
- **Educational Content**: Built-in rules explanation and history section
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
